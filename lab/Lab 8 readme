This script works by scrapping the nike website and showing the title and cost of a new pair of shoes

You first must have requests and beautifulsoup installed to python

I left comments throughout my text explaining each section. But mainly the script scrapes for specified tags and prints the data within that tags

beautifulsoup is how the webscrapping is possible.
