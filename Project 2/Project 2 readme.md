#You must first use (pip install pypng)  and   (pip install pyqrcode)  for this to work

#This is a program that asks you to enter text and it will convert the text to a qrcode image

#That QRCode image will be saved in the same location the script file is saved. It will be a png picture file named YourNewQRCode

#After running the script you will be provided with text explaining the script and asking you to enter information

#I suggest doing your email, because when testing the qrcode phone will suggest 
#sending an email to the address entered. I find this very useful.

#After you hit enter the photo of the qrcode will be created

#You can test this qrcode with your phones camera.
