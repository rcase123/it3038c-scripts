//I have so many passwords for different things that I thought it would be a good idea to create an offline password manager.

//For this script to work you must first install cryptography (pip install cryptography)

//You must then have the key.key file and the Final.py file in the same location on your device

//When you first run the code it will ask for the master password. I have it set to rob, no capitals. enter rob and hit enter

//It will then describe there are 3 options that you can do with the password manager. add, view, or quit.

//We have no passwords saved so we type add and hit enter, the script will now create a txt file that will contain our passwords

//Then enter a screen name and hit enter, along with the password and hit enter. 

//Enter the master password again to confirm the change.

//You can now choose view to see the password and screen name recorded, which will require the master password again. 

//if you look at the password.txt file you can see the screen name will an encrypted version of the password.

//All of this is possible thanks to the cryptography plug in that uses a generated from the commeted out code in the beginning of the script

//Now you can type the master password (rob) again and now type quit and enter to end the program.


//Thank you for trying out my code!
